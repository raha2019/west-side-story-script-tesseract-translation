ACT ONE
SCENE ONE

(The neighborhood. A suggestion of city streets and alleyways;
a workable brick wall.

#1 — Prologue (Orchestra)

The opening is musical: half-danced, half-mimed with occasional phrases of
dialogue. It is primarily a condensation of the growing rivalry between two
teenage gangs, the JETS and the SHARKS, each of which has its own prideful
uniform. The boys — side-burned, long-haired — are vital, restless, sardonic;
the SHARKS are Puerto Ricans, the JETS an anthology of what is called
“American.”

   

The action begins with the JETS in possession of the area: owning, enjoying,
loving their “home.” Their leader is RIFF: glowing, driving, intelligent,
slightly whacky. His lieutenant is DIESEL: big, slow, steady, nice. The
youngest member of the gang is BABY JOHN: awed at everything, including
that he is a JET, trying to act the big man. His buddy is A-RAB, an explosive
little ferret who enjoys everything and understands the seriousness of nothing.
The most aggressive is ACTION: a catlike ball of fury. We will get to know
these boys better Inter, as well as BIG DEAL — a bespectacled self-styled
expert.

The first interruption of the JETS’ sunny mood is the sharply punctuated
entrance of BERNARDO, the leader of the SHARKS: handsome, proud, fluid,
a chip on his sardonic shoulder. The JETS, by far in the majority, flick him off.
HE returns with other SHARKS: they, too, are flicked off. But the numerical
supremacy, the strength of the JETS is gradually being threatened. The begin-
nings of warfare are mild at first: a boy being tripped up or being sandbagged
with a flour sack or even being spit on. All with overly elaborate apologies.

Finally, A-RAB comes across the suddenly deserted area, pretending to be an
airplane. There is no sound as he zooms along in fancied flight. Then over the
wall drops BERNARDO. Another SHARK, another and another appear,
blocking A-RAB’S panicky efforts at escape. THEY close in, grab him,
pummel as a SHARK on top of the wall is stationed as look-out. Finally,
BERNARDO bends over A-RAB and makes a gesture (piercing his ear); the
look-out whistles; JETS tear on, SHARKS tear on, and a free-for-all breaks
out. RIFF goes at once to A-RAB like a protective father. It is stopped by a
POLICE WHISTLE louder and louder and the arrival of a big, goon-like cop
— KRUPKE — and a plainclothesman: SCHRANK. SCHRANK is strong,
always in command; he has a charming, pleasant manner which he often
employs to cover his venom and his fear)
Page 2 West SIDE STORY

 

KRUPKE

Knock it off! Settle down.

SCHRANK
All right: Kill each other! ...But not on my beat.

RIFF

(Such innocence)
Why if it isn’t Lt. Schrank!
SEVERAL JETS
(Dancing class manners)
Top of the day, Officer Krupke.

SCHRANK

Boy, what you Puerto Ricans have done to this neighborhood.
Which one of ‘em clobbered ya, A-rab?

(A-RAB looks to RIFF who takes over with great helpful seriousness)

RIFF

As a matter of factuality, sir, we suspicion the job was done by a cop.

 

BIG DEAL
Two cops.
A-RAB
Oh, at least!
KRUPKE
Impossible!
SCHRANK

Didn't nobody tell you there’s a difference between bein’ a stool pigeon and coop-
eratin’ with the law?

RIFF

You told us the difference, sir. And we all chipped in for a prize for the first guy
who can figure it out.
WesT SIDE STORY

ACTION
(Indicating SCHRANK)
Maybe buddy boy should get the prize.
SCHRANK

Don’t buddy boy me, Action! I got a hot surprise for you: you hoodlums don’t
own the streets. There’s been too much raiding between you and the PRs. All
right, Bernardo, get your trash outa here.

(Mock charm)
Please.
BERNARDO
Let’s go, Sharks.
(THEY EXIT)
SHRANK

If I don’t put down the roughhouse, I get put down — ona traffic corner. Your
friend don’t like traffic corners. So you buddy boys are gonna play ball with me. I
gotta put up with them and so do you. You're gonna make nice with them PRs
from now on. Because otherwise, I’m gonna beat the crap outa every one of ya and
then run ya in. Say goodbye to the nice boys, Krupke.

KRUPKE

Goodbye, boys.
(Follows SCHRANK out)

SNOWBOY
(Imitating KRUPKE)
Goodbye, boys.
A-RAB
They make a very nice couple.
ACTION

(Bitterly)
“You hoodlums don’t own the streets.”
BIG DEAL
Go play in the park!
Page 4 West SIDE STORY

 

ACTION
Keep off the grass!
BABY JOHN

Get outa the house!

ACTION
Keep off the block!

A-RAB

Get outa here!

ACTION

Keep off the world! A gang that don’t own a street is nuthin’!

RIFF
WE DO OWN IT! Jets — square off! Acemen:
(DIESEL, ACTION and BIG DEAL line up at attention)
Rocketmen:
(Three others line up)
Rank-and-file:
(Sheepishly, A-RAB trudges into position, BABY JOHN behind him)

BABY JOHN
(Shocked, to A-RAB)
Gee, your ear’s got blood on it!
A-RAB
(Proudly)
I'ma casual, Baby John.
BABY JOHN
(Examining the ear)
Those PRs! They branded you!
BIG DEAL

That makes you a Puerto Rican tomato. Cha cha cha, sefiorita!
West SIDE STORY Page 5

a,

RIFF
Cut the frabbajabba. Which one of the Sharks did it?
A-RAB

Bernardo. ‘Cause I hear him say: thees ees for stink-bombin’ my old man’s store.
(Makes the same gesture BERNARDO made when he pierced his ear)

BABY JOHN
Ouch!

ACTION

You shoulda done worse. Them PRs’re the reason my old man’s gone bust.

RIFF
Who says?
ACTION
My old man says.
BABY JOHN

My old man says his old man woulda gone bust anyway.

ACTION
Your old man says what?
BABY JOHN
My old man says them Puerto Ricans is ruinin’ free ennaprise.
ACTION

And what're we doin’ about it?

(Pushing through the gang comes a scrawny teenage girl, dressed in
an outfit that is a pathetic attempt to imitate that of the JETS. Perhaps
we have glimpsed her in the fracas before the police came in. Her
name:)

ANYBODYS
Gassin’, crabbin’ —

ACTION

You still around?
Page 6 Westr SIDE STORY

ANYBODYS

Lissen, I was a smash in that fight. Oh, Riff, Riff, I was murder!

RIFF
Come on, Anybodys —

ANYBODYS

Riff, how about me gettin’ in the gang now?

A-RAB

How about the gang gettin’ in — ahhh, who’d wanta!

ANYBODYS

You cheap beast!
(Lunges for A-RAB but RIFF pulls her off and pushes her out)

RIFF

The road, little lady, the road.
(In a moment of bravado, just before she goes, ANYBODYS spits —
but cautiously)
Round out!
(This is RIFF’S beckoning of the gang, and THEY surround him)
We fought hard for this territory and it’s ours. But with those cops servin’ as cover,

the PRs can move in right under our noses and take it away. UNLESS we speed
fast and clean ‘em up in one all-out fight!

ACTION
(Eagerly)
A rumble!
(A jabbing gesture)
Chung! Chung!
RIFF

Cool, Action boy. The Sharks want a place, too, and they are tough. They might
ask for bottles or knives or zip guns.

BABY JOHN
Zip guns... Gee!
WesT SIDE STORY

RIFF

I'm not finalizing and saying they will: I’m only saying they might and we gotta
be prepared. Now what's your mood?

ACTION

I say go, go!!

BIG DEAL
But if they say knives or guns —

BABY JOHN

I say let’s forget the whole thing.

SNOWBOY
What do you say, Riff?

RIFF

I say this turf is small, but it’s all we got. I wanna hold it like we always held it:
with skin! But if they say switchblades, I'll get a switchblade. I say I want the Jets
to be Number One, to sail, to hold the sky!

DIESEL
Then rev us off:
(A punching gesture)
Voom-va-voom!
ACTION
Chung chung!
A-RAB
(Gesture)
Cracko jacko!
SNOWBOY
(Gesture)
Riga diga dum!
BABY JOHN

(The wildest gesture of all)

Pam pam!
Page 8 Wesr SIDE STORY

 

RIFF
O.K., buddy boys, we rumble!
(General glee)

Now protocality calls for a war council to decide on weapons.
I'll make the challenge to Bernardo.

BIG DEAL
You gotta take a lieutenant.
ACTION
That's me!
RIFF
That's Tony.
ACTION
Who needs Tony?
(MUSIC starts)
RIFF

Against the Sharks we need every man we got.
ACTION
Tony don’t belong any more.
RIFF
Cut it, Action boy. I and Tony started the Jets.
ACTION
Well, he acts like he don’t wanna belong.
BABY JOHN
Who wouldn’t wanna belong to the Jets!
ACTION

Tony ain’t been with us for over a month.
WesT SIDE STORY

BIG DEAL
What about the day we clobbered the Emeralds?

A-RAB

Which we couldn’t have done without Tony.

BABY JOHN

He saved my ever lovin’ neck.

RIFF

Right. He’s always come through for us and he will now.
(SINGS)

WHEN YOU'RE A JET,
YOU'RE AJET ALL THE WAY
FROM YOUR FIRST CIGARETTE
TO YOUR LAST DYIN’ DAY.
WHEN YOU'RE A JET,
IF THE SPIT HITS THE FAN,

SCENE TWO

| (A yard.

On a small ladder, a good-looking sandy-haired boy is painting a
vertical sign that will say: DOC’S. Below, RIFF is haranguing)

RIFF
Riga tiga tum tum. Why not?... You can’t say you won't, Tony boy, without saying
why not?
TONY
(Grins)
Why not?
RIFF

Because it’s me askin’, Riff. Womb to tomb!

TONY
Sperm to worm!
(Surveying the sign)

You sure this looks like sky-writing?
WES 1 OLlve Vvkume

RIFF
It’s brilliant.
TONY

27 years the boss has had that drugstore. I want to surprise him with a new sign.
RIFF
(Shaking the ladder)
Tony, this is important!
TONY
Very important: Acemen, Rocket men.

RIFF

What's with you? Four and one-half years I live with a buddy and his family. Four
and one-half years, I think I know a man’s character. Buddy boy, Iam a victim of
disappointment in you.

TONY
End your suffering, little man. Why don’t you pack up your gear and clear out?

RIFF
‘Cause your ma’s hot for me.
(TONY grabs his arm and twists it)
No! ‘Cause I hate living with my buggin’ uncle uncle UNCLE!
(TONY releases him and climbs back up)

TONY
Now go play nice with the Jets.
RIFF
The Jets are the greatest!
TONY
Were.
RIFF
Are. You found something better?
TONY

No. But —
Page 14 West SIDE STORY

 

RIFF
But what?
TONY
You won't dig it.
RIFF
Try me.
TONY

O.K. Every single damn night for the last month, | wake up and I'm reaching out.
RIFF
For what?
TONY
| I don’t know, it’s right outside the door, around the corner. But it’s comin’!
RIFF
What is? Tell me!

TONY

I don’t know! It’s — like the kick I used to get from being a Jet.

RIFF
(Quietly)
...Or from being buddies.
TONY
We're still buddies.
RIFF

The kick comes from people, buddy boy.
TONY
Yeah, but not from being a Jet.

RIFF

No? Without a gang you're an orphan. With a gang you walk in twos, threes,
fours. And when your gang is the best, when you're a Jet, buddy boy, you're out
in the sun and home free home!
Ww fogs viwvg ve Vows

TONY
Riff, I’ve had it.
(Pause)

RIFF

Tony, the trouble is large: the Sharks bite hard!
We got to stop them now and we need you!

(Pause. Quietly)

I never asked the time of day from a clock, but I’m asking you:
Come to the dance tonight...

(TONY turns away)
... Lalready told the gang you'd be there.

TONY

(After a beat, turns to him with a grin)

What time?

RIFF
Ten?
TONY
Ten it is.
RIFF
Womb to tomb!
TONY

Sperm to worm! And I'll live to regret this.

RIFF

Who knows? Maybe what you’re waitin’ for’ll be twitching at the dance!

SCENE THREE

(Bridal shop.

A small section, enough to include table with sewing machine;

chair or two.

ANITA, a Puerto Rican girl with loose hair and a slightly flashy
“American” dress, is finishing remaking what was a white commu-
nion dress into a party dress for an extremely lovely, extremely young
girl: MARIA. ANITA is knowing, sexual, sharp. MARIA is an
excited, enthusiastic, obedient child mixed with the temper, stubborn
strength and awwareness of a woman)

MARIA

(Holding out scissors)

Por favor, Anita. Make the neck lower!

   

(Orchestra)
WesT SIDE STORY

r Page 18

ANITA
Stop it, Maria.
MARIA
| One inch. How much can one little inch do?
ANITA
Too much.
MARIA
(Exasperated)
Anita, it is now to be a dress for dancing, no longer for kneeling in front of an
altar.
ANITA
| With those boys you can start in dancing and end up kneeling.
MARIA

Querida, one little inch; una poca poca —
ANITA

Bernardo made me promise —

MARIA

Ai! Bernardo! One month have | been in this country — do Lever even touch excite--
ment? I sew all day, I sit all night. For what did my fine brother bring me here?

ANITA
To marry Chino.
MARIA
When I look at Chino, nothing happens.
ANITA
What do you expect to happen?

MARIA

I dunno: something. What happens when you look at Bernardo?

ANITA
It’s when I don’t look that it happens.
MARIA

[ think I will tell Mamma and Poppa about you and ‘Nardo in the balcony
of the movies.

ANITA

I'll rip this to shreds!
MARIA

No. But if you perhaps could manage to lower the neck —
ANITA

Next year.

MARIA

Next year I will be married to Chino and no one will care if it is down to here!

ANITA
Down to where?

MARIA
Down to here. I hate this dress!

ANITA

Then don’t wear it and don’t come with us to the dance.

MARIA
(Shocked)
Don’t come!
(Grabs the dress)
Could we not dye it red, at least?
ANITA

No, we could not.
(Starts to help MARIA into the dress)

MARIA

White is for babies. I will be the only one there in a white —

ANITA
Well???
Page 20 WesT SIDE STORY

Fann

re

MARIA
Ahhhh — si! It is a beautiful dress: I love you!

(As she hugs ANITA, BERNARDO ENTERS followed by a shy,
gentle, sweet-faced boy: CHINO)

| BERNARDO
Are you ready?
MARIA
Come in, ‘Nardo.
(Whirls in dress)
Is it not beautiful?
BERNARDO
| (Looking only at MARIA'S face)
Yes.
(Kisses her)
| Very.
ANITA
I didn’t quite hear...
BERNARDO

(Kissing her quite differently)
Very beautiful.
MARIA

(Watches them a second, then turns to CHINO)

Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.

CHINO
But this is a shop for ladies.
BERNARDO
Our ladies!
MARIA

‘Nardo, it is most important that I have a wonderful time at the dancing tonight.
BERNARDO

(As ANITA hooks up MARIA)
Why?

MARIA

Because tonight is the real beginning of my life as a young lady of America!

(SHE begins to whirl in the dress as the sop slides off and a flood of
gaily colored streamers pours down. As MARIA begins to turn and
turn, going OFFSTAGE, SHARK GIRLS, dressed for the dance, whirl
on, followed by JET GIRLS, by BOYS from both gangs. The streamers
fly up again with the drop to reveal:)

END OF SCENE THREE

#4 — The Dance At The Gym — Blues (Orchestra)

SCENE FOUR

(A dance hall.

Actually, a converted gymnasium of a settlement house, disguised for
the occasion with streamers and bunting.

Both gangs are jitterbugging wildly with their bodies but their faces,
although they are enjoying themselves, remain cool, almost detached.
The line between the two gangs is sharply defined by the colors they
wear: the JETS, girls as well as boys, reflecting the colors of the JET
jackets; and the same for the SHARKS. The dancing is a phyical and
emotional release for these kids.

MARIA ENTERS with CHINO, BERNARDO and ANITA. As she
looks around, delighted, thrilled by this, her first dance, the JETS catch
sight of BERNARDO wht is being greeted by PEPE, his lieutenant
and other SHARKS. As the music peters away, the JETS withdraw to
one side of the hall, around RIFF. The SHARKS, seeing this, draw to
their side, aound BERNARDO. A brief consultation, and RIFF starts
across — with lieutenants — to make his challenge to BERNARDO,
who starts — with his lieutenants — to meet him. The moment is brief
but it would be disastrous if a smiling, overly cheerful young man of
about 30 did not lhurry forward. HE is called GLAD HAND, and he is
a “square”)
Page 22 WesT SIDE STORY

Mg
GLAD HAND

(Beaming)
All right, boys and girls! Attention, please!
(Hum of talk)
Attention!
(KRUPKE appears behind GLAD HAND: the talk stops)
Thank you. It sure is a fine turnout tonight.
(Ad libs from the kids)

We want you to make friends here, so we're going to have a few get-together
dances.

(Ad-libs: “Oh, ginger peachy,” etc., etc.)
You form two circles: boys on the outside, girls on the inside.
| BIG DEAL
Where are you?

GLAD HAND

| (Tries to laugh at this)
All right. Now when the music stops, each boy dances with whichever girl is
opposite. O.K.? O.K. Two circles, kids.
(The KIDS clap their hands back at him and ad lib: “Two circles,
kids,” etc., etc. but do not move)
Well, it won’t hurt you to try.

BIG DEAL

(Limping forward)

Oh, it hurts; it hurts; it —
(KRUPKE steps forward. BIG DEAL straightens up and meekly returns to his
place. RIFF steps forward and beckons to his girl, VELMA. SHE is terribly
young, sexy, lost in a world of jive. She slithers forward to take her place with
RIFF. The challenge is met by BERNARDO who steps forward, leading ANITA
as though he were presenting the most magnificent lady in all the world. The
other KIDS follow, forming the two circles GLAD HAND requested)

GLAD HAND

That’s it, kids. Keep the ball rolling. ‘Round she goes and where she stops, nobody
knows. All right: here we go!
#44 — Promenade (Orchestra)

(Promenade music starts and the circles start revolving. GLAD
HAND, whistle to his mouth, is in the center with KRUPKE. HE

blows the WHISTLE and the MUSIC stops, leaving JET BOYS oppo-
site SHARK GIRLS and vice-versa. There is a moment of tenseness,
thent BERNARDO reaches across the JET GIRL opposite for ANITA‘S
hand, and she comes to him. RIFF reaches for VELMA, and the kids of
both gangs follow suit)

 

#4B — Maimbo (Orchestra)

The “get-together” has failed, and each side is on its own side of the
hall as mambo MUSIC starts)

SHARKS
(Shouted)
| MAMBO!
. JETS
(Shouted)
MAMBO!
ALL
GO!

(This turns into a challenge dance between BERNARDO and ANITA,
cheered on by the SHARKS, and RIFF and VELMA cheered on by the
JETS)

SHARKS
MAMBO!

MAMBO!

(TONY ENTERS and is momentarily embraced by RIFF who is
delighted that his best friend did turn up. The dance builds wilder
and wilder until at its peak, everybody is dancing)

GO, MAMBO!
(It is at this moment that TONY and MARIA — at opposite sides of
the hall — see each other. They have been cheering on their respective
friends, clapping in rhythm. Now, as they see each other, their voices
die, their smiles fade, their hands slowly go to their sides. The LIGHTS
fade on the others who disappear into the haze of the background as a
delicate cha cha begins and TONY and MARIA slowly walk forward
to meet each other.

 

#4C — Cha-Cha (Orchestra)

| Slowly, as though in a dream, they drift into the steps of the dance,
always looking at each other, completely lost in each other; unaware of
anything, any place, any time, anything but one another. Then:)

# 4D — Meeting Scene (Orchestra)

TONY

You’re not thinking I’m someone else?

MARIA
I know you are not.
TONY
Or that we have met before?
MARIA
I know we have not.
TONY

I felt, I knew something-never-before was going to happen, had to happen.
But this is —
(Interrupting)
My hands are cold.
(HE takes them in his)

| Yours, too.
(HE moves her hands to his face)

| So warm.
(SHE moves his hands to her face)
TONY
Yours, too.
MARIA
But of course. They are the same.
TONY

It's so much to believe — you’re not joking me?

MARIA

B I have not yet learned how to joke that way. I think now I never will.

(Impulsively, HE stops to kiss her hands;
then tenderly, innocently, her lips.

  

(Orchestra)

 

#4E — Jump

The music bursts out, the lights flare up and BERNARDO is upon
them in an icy rage)

BERNARDO
Go home, “American.”
TONY
Slow down, Bernardo.
BERNARDO

Stay away from my sister!
Page 26 West SItDBE STORY

TONY
...oister?
(RIFF steps up)
| BERNARDO
(To MARIA)
Couldn’t you see he’s one of them?
MARIA
No; I saw only him.
BERNARDO

| (As CHINO comes up)

I told you: there’s only one thing they want from a Puerto Rican gir!

TONY
That's a lie!
| RIFF
| Cool, boy.
CHINO
(To TONY)
Get away.
TONY
You keep out, Chino.
(To MARIA)
Don’t listen to them!
BERNARDO
She will listen to her brother before —
RIFF

(Overlapping)

If you characters want to settle —

GLAD HAND

 

Please! Everything was going so well! Do you fellows get pleasure out of making
trouble? Now come on — it won’t hurt you to have a good time.

(MUSIC starts again. BERNARDO is on one side with MARIA and
CHINO; ANITA joins them. TONY is on the other with RIFF and
DIESEL. Light emphasizes the first group)

BERNARDO
I warned you —
CHINO
Do not yell at her, “Nardo.
BERNARDO
You yell at babies.
ANITA

And put ideas in the baby’s head.

BERNARDO
Take her home, Chino.
MARIA
‘Nardo, it is my first dance.
BERNARDO

Please. We are family, Maria. Go.

(MARIA hesitates, then starts out with CHINO as the light cross
fades with her to the other group which she passes)

RIFF

(To DIESEL, indicating TONY happily)
I guess the kid’s with us for sure now.

(TONY doesn’t even hear; HE is staring at MARIA
who stops for a moment)

CHINO
Come, Maria.
(THEY continue out)

TONY

Maria...
Page 28 WeEsST SIDE STORY

(HE is unaware that BERNARDO is crossing towards him but
RIFF intercepts)

BERNARDO

I don’t want you.

RIFF
I want you, though. For a War Council — Jets and Sharks.

BERNARDO
The pleasure is mine.
RIFF
| Let’s go outside.
BERNARDO

| I would not leave ladies here alone. We will meet you in half an hour.

RIFF
Doc’s drugstore?
| (BERNARDO nods)
| And no jazz before then.
BERNARDO

I understand the rules — Native Boy.
(The light is fading on them, on everyone but TONY)

RIFF
Spread the word, Big Deal.
BIG DEAL
Right, Daddy-o.
RIFF

Let’s get the chicks and kick it. Tony?
(The LIGHTS dim out, except for a spotlight on TONY)

TONY

Maria...
(In darkness)

DIESEL
(In darkness)
Ah, we'll see him at Doc’s.
TONY

MARIA!

I’ VE JUST KISSED A GIRL NAMED MARIA,

And she does appear, at the window above him which opens onto the
fire escape)

BERNARDO and ANITA ENTER, followed by INDIO and PEPE
and their GIRLS. One is a bleached blond, bangled beauty:
CONSUELA. The other, quietly dressed in Spanish undertones, is

ROSALIA. SHE is not too bright)

END OF SCENE FIVE

SCENE SIX

(A Drugstore.

A suggestion of a rundown, musty, general store which, in cities, 1s a
“drugstore.” A door leading to the street outside; another leading to
the cellar below.

BABY JOHN is reading a comic book; A-RAB is playing solitaire;
ANYBODYS is huddled by the juke-box; ACTION is watching the
street door. The atmosphere is tense, jumpy. ACTION slams the door
and strides to the dart board)

ACTION

Where the devil are they? Are we having a War Council tonight or ain’t we?

(Throws a dart savagely)

BABY JOHN
He don’t use knives. He don’t even use a atomic ray gun.

I swear the next creep who calls me hoodlum —

RIFF
You'll laugh! Yeah. Now you all better dig this and dig it the most. No matter who

(This leads into a frenetic dance in which the boys and girls release
their emotions and get “cool.” It finishes, starts again when a JET
bounces in with the gang whistle. Everyone but RIFF and VELMA
stops dancing. A moment, then BERNARDO, CHINO, PEPE and
INDIO ENTER. Tension, but RIFF dances a moment longer. Then lie
pats VELMA on her behind. Followed by GRAZIELLA, she runs out,
slithering past the SHARKS. ANYBODYS is back, huddled by the

| juke-box but RIFF spots her, SHE gives him a pleading let-me-stay
look, but he gestures for her to go. Unlike the other girls, ANYBODYS
shoves the SHARKS like a big tough man as she EXITS)

| with laws: and I can find the right. I got the badge, you got the skin. It’s tough all
over. Beat it!

(A second. Then RIFF nods once to BERNARDO who nods to lhis
GANG. Slowly, THEY file out. BERNARDO starts to whistle “My
Country ‘Tis of Thee” as he EXITS proudly. His GANG joins in,
finishing a sardonic jazz lick OFFSTAGE.

SCHRANK, pleasantly)

_ From their angle, sure. Say, where's the rumble gonna be? Ah, look: I know reguli
Americans don’t rub with the gold-teeth otherwise. The river? The Park?

(Silence)

I'm for you. I want this beat cleaned up and you can do it for me. I'll even lend a
| hand if it gets rough. Where you gonna rumble? The playground? Sweeney's lot?

(Angered by the silence)

Ya think I’m a lousy stool pigeon? I wanna help ya get rid of them! Come on!
Where's it gonna be? ... Get smart, you stupid hoodlums! I oughta fine ya for

| litterin’ the streets. You oughta be taken down the station house and have your
skulls mashed to a pulp! You and the tin horn immigrant scum you come from!
How’s your old man’s DT’s, A-rab? How’s the action on your mother’s mattress,
Action?
(ACTION lunges for him but is tripped up by RIFF. SCHRANK
courches low, ready for him.

Quiet now:)
Let him go, buddy boy, just let him go.
(ACTION starts to his feet but DIESEL holds him)

One of these days there won't be nobody to hold you.

(RIFE deliberately starts for the door, followed by the OTHERS,
except TONY.

As they go:)

I'll find out where ya gonna rumble. But be sure to finish each other off.
Because if you don’t I will!

(RIFE lias stayed at the door until the OTHERS have passed through.
Now he just looks at SCHRANK and cockily saunters out. Silence.

SCHRANK looks at DOC)
Well, you try keepin’ hoodlums in line and see what it does to you.
(EXITS)

DOC

It wouldn't give me a mouth like his.

TONY
Yeah.

What have you been taking tonight?
Page 60 WesT SIDE STORY

TONY

A trip to the moon. And I'll tell you a secret. It isn’t a man that’s up there, Doc.
It’s a girl, a lady.

(Opens the door)

Well, buenas noches, sefior.

DOC
Buenas noches?! So that’s why you made it a fair fight.
(TONY smiles)

... Tony... things aren’t tough enough?

 

TONY
Tough? Doc, I’m in love!
DOC
How do you know?
TONY

| Because... there isn’t any other way I could feel.

And you're not frightened?
TONY
Should I be?

Why? I'm frightened enough for both of you.

SCENE SEVEN

(Bridal Shop.

| Hot late afternoon sun coloring the work room. One or two sewing
machines. Several dressmaker dummies, male and female, in bridal
party garb.
MARIA, in a smock, is hand-sewing a wedding veil as ANITA whirls
in whipping off her smock)

ANITA
She’s gone! That old bag of a bruja has gone!
MARIA

Brava!

ANITA

The day is over, the jail is open, home we go!

MARIA
You go, querida. I will lock up.

ANITA
Finish tomorrow. Come!

MARIA
But I am in no hurry.

ANITA

lam. I’m going to take a bubble bath all during supper: Black Orchid.

MARIA

You will not eat?

ANITA
After the rumble — with ‘Nardo.

MARIA

(Sewing angrily)

That rumble, why do they have it?

ANITA

You saw how they dance: like they have to get rid of something quick.
That's how they fight.

MARIA
To get rid of what?
Page 62 West SIDE STORY

ANITA

Too much feeling. And they get rid of it: after a fight, that brother of yours is so
healthy! Definitely: Black Orchid.

(Knock at rear door and TONY ENTERS)

TONY
Buenas noches!
ANITA
(Sarcastically, to MARIA)
“You go, querida. I’ll lock up.”
(To TONY)

It’s too early for noches. Buenas tardes.

TONY
(Bows)
Gracias. Buenas tardes.
MARIA
He just came to deliver aspirin.
ANITA
You'll need it.
TONY
No, we’re out of the world.
ANITA
You're out of your heads.
TONY
We're twelve feet in the air.
MARIA

(Gently taking his hand)
Anita can see all that.
(To ANITA)

You will not tell?
ee

ANITA

Tell what? How can I hear what goes on twelve feet over my head?
(Opens door — to MARIA)

You better be home in fifteen minutes.

(SHE goes out)
TONY
Don’t worry. She likes us!
MARIA
But she is worried.
TONY

She’s foolish. We’re untouchable; we are in the air; we have magic!

MARIA

Magic is also evil and black. Are you going to that rumble?

TONY
No.
MARIA
Yes.
TONY
Why??
MARIA
You must go and stop it.
TONY

I have stopped it! It’s only a fist fight. ‘Nardo won't get —
MARIA
Any fight is not good for us.
TONY

Everything is good for us and we are good for everything.

MARIA

Listen and hear me. You must go and stop it.
Page 64 WeEstT SIDE STORY

 

TONY
Then I will.
MARIA
(Surprised)
Can you?
TONY

You don’t want even a fist fight? There won’t be any fight.
MARIA
1 believe you! You do have magic.

TONY

Of course, I have you. You go home and dress up.

 

#9 — Under Dialogue - (Orchestra)

Then tonight, I will come by for you.

MARIA
You cannot come by. My mama...
TONY
(After a pause)
Then I will take you to my house —
MARIA
(Shaking her head)
Your mama...

(Another awkward pause. Then he sees a female dummy and pushes it
forward saying:)

TONY

She will come running from the kitchen to welcome you. She lives in the kitchen.

MARIA

Dressed so elegant?
TONY

I told her you were coming. She will look at your face and try not to smile.
And she will say: Skinny — but pretty.

MARIA
She is plump, no doubt.

TONY

(Holding the waist of dummy’s dress)
Fat!

MARIA

(Indicating another female dummy)

I take after my mama; delicate boned.
(HE kisses her)

Not in front of Mama!

(HE turns the dummy around as she goes to a male dummy)

Oh, I would like to see Poppa in this! Mama will make him ask about your
prospects,. if you go to church. But Poppa — Poppa might like you.

TONY

(Kneeling to the “father” dummy)
May I have your daughter’s hand?

MARIA
He says Yes.
TONY
Gracias!
MARIA
And your mama?
TONY
I'm afraid to ask her.
MARIA

Tell her she’s not getting a daughter; she’s getting rid of a son!
Page 66 WesT SIDE STORY

 

 

TONY

She says Yes.

MARIA

She has good taste.

(SHE grabs up the wedding veil and puts it on as TONY
arranges the dunuiiies)

TONY
Maid of Honor!
MARIA
That color is bad for Anita.
TONY
Best man!
MARIA
That is my Poppa!
TONY

Sorry, Poppa. Here we go, Riff: Womb to Tomb!
, (Takes hat off duinmy)

MARIA

Now you see, Anita, I told you there was nothing to worry about.

#9A — One Hand, One Heart (Tony, Maria)

(MUSIC starts as she leaves the duminy and walks up to TONY.
THEY look at each other — and the playing vanishes. Slowly, seri-
ously, they turn front and, together, kneel as before an altar)
TONY
1, Anton, take thee, Maria...
| MARIA

1, Maria, take thee, Anton...
For richer, for poorer —

MARIA
In sickness and in health...
TONY
To love and to honor...
MARIA
To hold and to keep...
TONY
From each sun to each moon...
MARIA
From tomorrow to tomorrow...
TONY
From now to forever...
MARIA
Till death do us part.
TONY
With this ring, I thee wed.
MARIA

With this ring, I thee wed.
(The MUSIC becomes a love duet:)

TONY

MAKE OF OUR HANDS ONE HAND,
MAKE OF OUR HEARTS ONE HEART,
MAKE OF OUR VOWS ONE LAST VOW:
ONLY DEATH WILL PART US NOW.

MARIA

MAKE OF OUR LIVES ONE LIFE,
DAY AFTER DAY, ONE LIFE.

TONY, MARIA

NOW IT BEGINS, NOW WE START

ONE HAND, ONE HEART —

EVEN DEATH WON'T PART US NOW.
(THEY look at each other, then at the reality of their “game.” They
smile tenderly, ruefully and slowly put the dummies back into posi-
tion. But even back in the world, they sing:)

TONY, MARIA

END OF SCENE EIGHT
SCENE NINE

(Under the highway.

A dead end: rotting plaster-and-brick walls and mesh wire fences.
A street lamp.

It is nightfall. The almost-silhouetted GANGS come in from separate
sides: climbing over the fences or crawling through holes in the walls.
There is silence as they fan out on opposite sides of the cleared space.

Then BERNARDO and DIESEL remove their jackets, handing them
to their seconds: CHINO and RIFF)

BERNARDO
Ready.
CHINO
Ready!
DIESEL
Ready.
RIFF

Ready! Come center and shake hands.
BERNARDO
For what?
RIFF
That’s how it’s done, buddy boy.

BERNARDO

More gracious living? Look: I don’t go for that pretend crap you all go for in this
country. Every one of you hates every one of us and we hate you right back. I
don’t drink with nobody I hate, I don’t shake hands with nobody I hate. Let's get
at it.

RIFF
Okay.

BERNARDO

(Moving toward CENTER)

Here we go.
Page 74 West SIDE STORY

Wf

(DIESEL begins to move toward him. There are encouragements called
from each side. The “fair fight” is just beginning when:)

TONY
Hold it!
(HE leaps over a fence and starts to BERNARDO)

RIFF
Get with the gang.
, TONY
No.
| RIFF
What're you doing?

| BERNARDO
Maybe he has found the guts to fight his own battles.

TONY

| | (Smiling)
It doesn’t take guts if you have a battle. But we haven't got one, ‘Nardo.

(HE extends his hand for BERNARDO to shake it. BERNARDO
knocks the hand away and gives TONY a shove that send him
sprawling)

BERNARDO

Bernardo.

RIFF

(Quiet, strong)

The deal is a fair fight between you and Diesel.
(To TONY, who has gotten up)

Get with the gang.

(During the next, BERNARDO flicks TONY'S shirt, pusltes his
| shoulder, pinches cheek)
i

 

BERNARDO
(To TONY)
I'll give you a battle, Kiddando.
DIESEL
You've got one.
BERNARDO

I'll take pretty-boy on as a warm-up. Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, chicken?
Afraid, gutless?

RIFF

 

Cut that —

TONY

I don’t want to, Bernardo...
(Meaning “Want to let go”)

BERNARDO
I’m sure.
TONY
Bernardo, you've got it wrong.
BERNARDO
Are you chicken?
TONY
You won’t understand!
BERNARDO
What d’ya say, chicken?
ACTION
Get him, Tony!
BERNARDO
He is chicken.
DIESEL

Page 76 WesT SIDE STORY

Come on, you yellow-bellied Polak bas —

#11 — The Ruimble (Orchestra)

(HE never finishes, for RIFF hauls off and hits him. Inmediately,

the two GANGS alert and the action goes into dance form. As

BERNARDO reels back to his feet, he reaches for his back pocket.

RIFE reaches for his back pocket and at the same instant, each brings

forth a gleaming knife. THEY jockey for position, feinting, dueling;
the two GANGS shift position, now and again temporarily obscuring

| the fighters. TONY tries to get between them)
a §_$—$

Hold him!

Riff, don’t!

MARIA!

END

END

 

RIFF

(DIESEL and ACTION grab TONY and hold him back. The fight ia
continues. RIFF loses his knife, is passed another by a JET. At last, i
he has BERNARDO in a position where it seems that he will be able
to run him through. TONY breaks from DIESEL and moves to stop
RIFF, crying:)

TONY

(RIFE hesitates a moment; the moment is enough for BERNARDO
whose hand goes forward with a driving motion, running his knife
into RIFE. TONY leaps forward to catch RIFF. HE breaks his fall, then
takes the knife from his hand. A free-for-all has broken out as TONY,
RIFF’S knife in hand, leaps at the triumphant BERNARDO. All this
happens terribly fast; and TONY rams his knife into BERNARDO.
The free-for-all continues a moment longer. Then a sharp police
whistle. Everything comes to a dead stop, dead silence. Then a distant
police siren: the KIDS waver, run one way, another; panic, confusion.
As the stage is cleared, TONY stands, horrified, over the still bodies of
RIFE and BERNARDO. HE bends over RIFF’S body; then he rolls
over BERNARDO’S body — and stares)

TONY

(An anguished cry)

(Another police whistle, closer now, but he doesn’t move. From the
shadows, ANYBODYS appears. SHE scurries to TONY and tugs at
his arm. A siren, another whistle, then a searchlight cuts across the
playground. ANYBODYS’ insistent tugging brings TONY to the
realization of the danger. HE crouches, starts to run with her to one
escapeway. SHE reaches it first, goes out — but the searchlight hits it
just as he would go through. HE stops, runs the other way. He darts
here, there and finally gets away as a distant clock begins to boom and:

THE CURTAIN FALLS)

showing that she is dressed)

Chino, is Tony all right?!

He killed your brother.

searches behind furniture and comes up with an object wrapped in the
same color as BERNARDO’S shirt. From the bedroom, louder:)

You are lying, Chino!
(Coldly, CHINO unwraps a gun which he puts in his pocket. There is
the SOUND OF A POLICE SIREN at distance. HE goes out. During
this, MARIA has knelt before the shrine on the wall. SHE rocks back
and forth in prayer, some of it in Spanish, some of it in English:)

Make it not be true... please make it not be true... I will do anything: make me
die... Only please — make it not be true.
(As she prays, TONY appears at the fire escape window and quietly
climbs in. His shirt is ripped, almost half-torn off. He stands still,
lintp, watching her. Aware that someone is in the room, she stops her
prayers. Slowly, her head turns; she looks at him for a long monient.

I tried to stop it; I did try. I don’t know how it went wrong... I didn’t mean to hurt
him; I didn’t want to; I didn’t know Thad. But Riff... Riff was like my brother. So
when Bernardo killed him —

(She lifts her head)

’Nardo didn’t mean it, either. Oh, I know he didn’t! Oh, no. I didn’t come to tell
you. Just for you to forgive me so I could go to the police —

 

 

MARIA
No!
TONY
It’s easy now —
MARIA
No..
TONY
Whatever you want, I'll do —
MARIA
Stay. Stay with me.
TONY
I love you so much.
MARIA
Tighter.
TONY

We'll be all right. I know it. We're really together now.

MARIA

But it’s not us! It’s everything around us!

TONY

(His voice gradually rising into song)

Then we'll find someplace where nothing can get to us; not one of them,
not anything.

#13A — Ballet Sequence (Tony, Maria)

AND I’LL TAKE YOU AWAY,

TAKE YOU FAR FAR AWAY OUT OF HERE,
FAR FAR AWAY TILL THE WALLS

AND THE STREETS DISAPPEAR,

MARIA, TONY

SOMEWHERE THERE MUST BE A PLACE
WE CAN FEEL WE'RE FREE,
SOMEWHERE THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOME PLACE FOR YOU AND FOR ME.

(As they sing, the walls of the apartment begin to move off,
leaving city walls surrounding them moving in on them.

#13B — Transition To Scherzo (Orchestra)

#13C — Scherzo (Orchestra)

Then the apartment itself goes and the two LOVERS begin to run,
battering against the walls of the city, breaking through as chaotic
figures of the gangs, of the violence flail around them. But they do
break through and suddenly — they are ina world of space and air
and sun. They stop, looking at it, pleased, startled as BOYS and
GIRLS from both sides come on. And they, too, stop and stare, happy,
pleased.

Their clothes are soft, pastel versions of what they have worn before.
They begin to dance, to play: no sides, no hostility now; just joy and
pleasure and warmth. More and more join, making a world that
TONY and MARIA want to be in, belong to, to share their love witlt.
As they begin the steps of a gently love dance, a GIRL is heard
SINGING:)

#13E — Procession And Nightinare (Tony, Maria, Company)

(The LOVERS hold out their hands to each other; the others follow
suit: JETS to SHARKS; SHARKS to JETS. And THEY form what is
almost a procession winding its triumphant way through this would-
be world, as they sing the words of the song with wonderment)

(Then, suddenly, there is a dead stop. The harsh shadows, the fire
escapes of the real tenement cloud the sky and the figures of RIFF and
BERNARDO slowly walk on. The dream becomes a nightmare: as the
city returns, there are brief re-enactments of the knife fight, of the
deaths. MARIA and TONY are once again separated from each other
by the violent warring of the two sides. MARIA tries to reach
BERNARDO, TONY tries to stop RIFF; the LOVERS try to reach
each other but they cannot get there. Chaotic confusion and blackness
out of which they find themselves back in the bedroom, clinging to
each other desperately. With a blind refusal to face what they know
must be, they reassure each other deperately as they SING:)

A fence with loose boards; angles between buildings.

Softly, from behind the fence, the JET GANG whistle. A second, then
the answering whistle, softly, OFFSTAGE or around a corner. Now

the loose board flips up and BABY JOHN wriggles through the fence.

HE whistles again, and timidly, and A-RAB comes on)

whistle like mad. The moment he is off, BOTH appear through the

(The apartment.

The light is, at first, a vague glow on the lovers who are asleep on the
bed. The music is based on that which ended the first apartment scene.
From OFFSTAGE, faint at first, the sound of knocking. It gets louder,
TONY stirs. Ata distance, a police siren and the knocking very loud.
TONY bolts upright. ANITA comes in from outside and goes to the
hedroom door — which is locked — tries the knob, calling:)

he puts his hand, then his lips on her lips)

(Over-riding angrily)
Why dlo you live like there’s a war on?
(Low)
Why do you kill?
TONY
I told you how it happened, Doc. Maria understands. Why can’t you?
DOC
I never had a Maria.
TONY
(Gently)

Lhave, and I'll tell you one thing, Doc. Even if it only lasts from one night
to the next, it’s worth the world.

poc
That's all it did last.
TONY
What?
DOC

That was no customer upstairs, just now. That was Anita.
(Pause)
Maria is dead. Chino found out about you and her — and shot her.

(A brief moment. TONY looks at DOC, stunned, numb. HE shakes his
head as though he cannot believe this. DOC holds out his hands to him
but TONY backs away, then suddenly turns and runs out the door.

As he does, the set flies away and the stage goes dark. In the darkness,
qwe htear:)

TONY

Chino? Chino? Come and get me, too, Chino.

END OF SCENE FIVE

SCENE SIX

(The neighborhood.

The LIGHTS come up to reveal the same set as in the opening.
But it is now jagged with shadows. TONY stands in the emptiness,
calling, whirling around as a figure darts our of the shadows and then
runs off again)
TONY
Chino?... COME ON: GET ME, TOO!

ANYBODYS

(A whisper from the dark)

Tony...
TONY
(Swings around)
Who’s that?
ANYBODYS
(Darting on)
Me: Anybodys.
TONY

Get outa here. HEY, CHINO! COME GET ME, DAMN YOU!

ANYBODYS
What're you doin’, Tony?
TONY
I said get outa here! CHINO!
ANYBODYS

Look, maybe if you and me just —

TONY
(Savagely)
It's not playing any more! Can’t any of you get that?
ANYBODYS
But the gang —

TONY
You're a girl: be a girl! Beat it.
(SHE retreats)
CHINO, I'M CALLING FOR YA, CHINO! HURRY! IT’S CLEAR NOW. THERE'S

NOBODY BUT ME. COME OW! Will ya, please. I’m waitin’ for ya.
I want you to —

(Suddenly, all the way across the stage from him, a FIGURE steps
out of the dark. HE stops and peers as light starts to glow out it.
An unbelievable whisper:)

Maria... Maria?

MARIA
Tony...
(As she holds out her arms towards him, another figure appears: CHINO)
TONY
MARIA!

(As they run to each other, there is a gun shot. TONY stumbles as
though he tripped. MARIA catches him and cradles him in her arms as
he falters to the ground. During this, BABY JOHN and A-RAB run on;
then PEPE and INDIO and other SHARKS. CHINO stands very still,
bewildered by the gun limp in his hand. More JETS and SHARKS, some
GIRLS run on and DOC comes out to stare with them)

I didn’t believe hard enough.

MARIA
Loving is enough.
TONY
Not here. They won't let us be.
MARIA

Then we'll get away.
West SIDE STORY Page 119

TONY
Yes, we can. We will.

(HE shivers, as though a pain went through him. SHE holds him
closer and begins to SING — without orchestra:)

ne na

MARIA

HOLD MY HAND AND WE’RE HALFWAY THERE.

(TONY joins in. MARIA SINGS harder as though to urge him
back to life)

TONY, MARIA
HOLD MY HAND AND I'LL TAKE YOU THERE,
SOMEHOW,
(TONY'S voice falters)

MARIA

SOME DAY...
(MARIA stops, TONY'S body quiet in her arms.
A moment, and then, as she gently rests TONY on the floor,
the ORCHESTRA finishes the last bars of the song. Lightly,
slie brushes TONY'S lips with her fingers. Behind her, ACTION,
in front of a group of JETS, moves to lead them toward CHINO.
Cold, sharp)
Stay back.
(The shawl she has had around her shoulders slips to the ground as she
gets up, walks to CHINO and holds out her hand. HE hands her the gun.
Ina flat, hard voice:)
How do you fire this gun, Chino? Just by pulling this little trigger?
(SHE points it at him suddenly; HE draws back.
SHE has all of them in front of her now, as she holds the gun out
and her voice gets stronger with anger and savage rage)

How many bullets are left, Chino? Enough for you?

(At another)
And you?
(At ACTION)

All of you? WE ALL KILLED HIM; and my brother and Riff. , too.

I CAN KILL NOW BECAUSE I HATE NOW.
(SHE has been pointing the gun wildly and THEY have all been
drawing back. Now, again, SHE holds it straight out at ACTION)

How many can | kill, Chino? How many — and still have one bullet left for me?

(Both hands on the gun, SHE pushes it forward at ACTION. But
SHE cannot fire and as she breaks into tears, hurls the gun away and
sinks to the ground.

SCHRANK walks ont, looks around and starts toward TONY'S body.

Like a madwoman, MARIA races to the body and puts her arms
around it, all-embracing, protecting as slie cries:)

DON’T YOU TOUCH HIM!

(SCHRANK steps back. KRUPKE has appeared in the shadows behind
him. MARIA now turns and looks at CHINO, holds her hand out to
him. Slowly HE comes and stands by the body. Now SHE looks at
ACTION, holds out her land to him. HE, too, comes forward, with
DIESEL, to stand by the body. PEPE joins CHINO. Then, MARIA
Icans low over TONY'S face.

Softly, privately:)
Te adoro, Anton.

(SHE kisses Iti gently.

MUSIC starts as the two JETS and two SHARKS lift up TONY'S
body and start to carry him out. The others, BOYS and GIRLS, fall in
behind to make a procession, the same procession they made in the
dream ballet as BABY JOHN comes forward to pick up MARIA’S
slunl and put it over her head. SHE sits quietly like a woman in
mourning as the MUSIC builds, the LIGHTS start to come up and the
procession makes its way across the stage. At last, she gets up and
despite the tears on her face, lifts her head proudly and triumphantly
turns to follow the others. The adults — DOC, SCHRANK,
KRUPKE, GLAD HAND ~ are left bowed, alone, useless as:

THE CURTAIN FALLS)

THE END
